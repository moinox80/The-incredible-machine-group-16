## Premise
A terrible rendition of Pokémon. It's not even worthy of the label 'clone', and is more like a cursed amalgamation of the idea of the famous Pokémon series, than an actual, playable, game.

## Features
- A 16x2 LCD screen to display the battle options
- A monochrome OLED on which the sprites are drawn.
- A piezo to play the sound effects and victory music.
- Has nice, hand-drawn sprites.
